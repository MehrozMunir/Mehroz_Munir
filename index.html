  <h1>My Love for Cricket</h1>

  <p>
    Cricket has always been one of my favourite sports because of its excitement, unpredictability, 
    and the passion it brings out in fans. Even though I am Pakistani and absolutely love watching 
    Pakistan play, the matches can sometimes be heartbreaking when the team performs poorly. 
    Still, the thrill keeps me coming back every time. Interestingly, my favourite player is Ben Stokes, 
    whose aggression, calmness under pressure, and incredible match-winning ability always inspire me. 
    I also enjoy watching matches played by India, Australia, England, and South Africa because these teams 
    make the sport extremely competitive and entertaining. Cricket, for me, is not just a game—it’s an emotion.
